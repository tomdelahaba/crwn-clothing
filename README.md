# ABOUT

This project from Zerotomastery academy is one of my best projects I am working on and I implemented yet. Its fully working ecommerce platform where I can touch and play with multiple tools as redux (not implemented yet), graphql (not implemented yet), firebase are.
I would like to focus on many different things in here including testing.

# STATUS

Still in development, I assume I am in 25-30% of the project yet.

## STRONG SIDES

- good file structure
- components are as minimal as they can
- this is really becoming a master project

## WEAK SIDES

- it will become really complex
- as there are many different tools used, I am forgetting some of the parts so I will need to go throught that one more time
- sometime, without help of Yihua or Andrei tutorials I would use a little different structure, but as they are really seniors, I am getting used to their architecture and structure of react development
